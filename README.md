## Notes:
The file named Example-Au-Ti-SiC corresponds to the Au-Ti-SiC sample in our paper (Yali Mao et al. Deep learning-based data processing method for transient thermoreflectance Measurements). The file named Example-GaN-Si corresponds to the GaN on Si sample in our paper.
The .ipynb is the model, the mat format file is the dataset, and the csv file is the experimental data.  
The dataset for GaN-Si is too large to upload, if you need it please contact chaoyuan@whu.edu.cn
